The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Buddy application as an AI companion for children. Key accomplishments include developing a multi-agent backend, integrating Deepgram for voice and Gemini for conversation, and expanding the content library into a world-beater system with a 3-tier sourcing hierarchy. The engineer meticulously addressed early UI/UX and routing issues, making significant improvements to components like  and .

However, the trajectory reveals a persistent struggle with core voice functionality (STT/TTS and wake word detection) and text input reliability. Multiple fixes were attempted, oscillating between Deepgram SDK and direct REST API calls, and tackling  compatibility issues. Despite claims of complete functionality, user reports consistently indicated failures. The text input also suffered from re-rendering bugs, eventually addressed with a Grok-suggested component isolation, though backend message sending issues may remain. The engineer's latest action is to re-evaluate the voice pipeline by studying a proven external GitHub repository, acknowledging the need for a more robust, battle-tested approach like those in commercial voice bots.

<product_requirements>
The Buddy application aims to be an emotionally intelligent, multi-lingual AI voice companion for children aged 3-12. It should function as a friend, teacher, counselor, coach, and playmate. Core features include a multi-agent backend (FastAPI), real-time voice interaction (Deepgram STT/TTS, wake word, ambient listening), conversational AI (Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash for context-aware, emotionally intelligent responses), a rich content library (stories, songs, games) with a 3-tier sourcing hierarchy (local, internet, LLM-generated), a child-friendly UI/UX (React), robust child profile management, comprehensive parental controls, and long-term memory with telemetry tracking. Post-MVP requirements emphasized a persistent, real-time, always-on experience, involving UI/UX uplift, expanded child profile options (gender, avatar, voice preferences, learning goals), and must-have features like mic lock and break logic. The content library was a significant focus, requiring engaging, age-appropriate, culturally relevant, and dynamically personalized material from free/open-source content.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a significant content library expansion, making it world-beater quality with over 35 diverse content pieces. This involved creating  and integrating it with  and  to support a 3-tier content sourcing hierarchy. Backend testing showed 94.1% success for this new content system, and the  endpoint was successfully implemented, resolving the Stories page loading failure.

However, core voice functionality has been a persistent critical issue. Despite multiple attempts to fix STT/TTS (in  through Deepgram SDK, then switching to  REST calls to avoid SDK issues, battling  version incompatibilities), the wake word () and general voice interaction remained non-functional as reported by the user. The text input field also suffered from a single-character bug due to React re-rendering, which was addressed by isolating it into a new  component based on a Grok Report analysis. A new  component was also introduced for proper microphone permission handling.

Despite these fixes and claims of complete functionality in testing, the user continues to report that the voice features are not working, indicating Voice processing failed. The AI engineer has now acknowledged the need for a more robust solution and is currently studying a working GitHub repository (), specifically examining  to understand its successful Deepgram STT/TTS implementation, which appears to utilize Supabase Edge Functions for direct API interactions. The immediate focus is to learn from this reference implementation to finally resolve the voice issues.
