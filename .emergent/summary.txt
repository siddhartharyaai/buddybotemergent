The previous AI engineer meticulously followed the user's iterative development requests for a Multi-Lingual AI Companion Device for Children (renamed Buddy). The process started with a detailed document analysis and culminated in a fully functional MVP. The engineer demonstrated strong planning, problem-solving (e.g., PDF extraction, secure API key handling), and iterative development. Key achievements include a multi-agent backend, a world-class React UI, and initial integrations of Deepgram and Gemini for voice and conversation. The work then shifted to enhancing the core experience by implementing real-time ambient listening and wake word detection, followed by integrating advanced emotional intelligence, dialogue orchestration, and long-term memory features. The engineer is currently in the process of integrating these new addon-plan agents into the main orchestrator, showcasing a systematic approach to complex feature development.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a multi-agent web app MVP for a Multi-Lingual AI Companion Device for Children based on an uploaded PDF. The app, later named Buddy, aims to be an emotionally intelligent voice companion for children aged 3-12, serving as a friend, teacher, counselor, coach, and playmate.

Core requirements include:
- **Multi-Agent System**: Main orchestrator with sub-agents for language processing (STT/TTS), conversation, safety, multilingual support, session management, and parental controls.
- **Voice Interaction**: Real-time wake word (Hey Buddy, Buddy, Hi Buddy) and ambient listening, Deepgram Nova 3 (STT) and Aura 2 (TTS) with child speech pattern understanding, streaming TTS with barge-in detection.
- **AI Core**: Gemini 2.0 Flash or 2.5 Flash for reasoning, planning, age-adaptive, context-aware, emotionally intelligent responses (sentiment/energy classification), and conversational repair.
- **Content Library**: Stories, songs, nursery rhymes, educational materials, games. MVP focused on English and free/open-source content, with Hindi/Hinglish understanding via STT. Future expansion to 10+ Indian languages and cultural content.
- **User Experience**: World-class, professional yet child-friendly UI/UX, responsive design.
- **Profile Management**: Robust profile section for children (name, age, location, interests, voice personality).
- **Parental Controls**: Comprehensive dashboard with time limits, content restrictions, quiet hours, activity monitoring, and notifications.
- **Long-Term Memory**: In-session memory with daily summaries for parent audit.
- **Telemetry & Flags**: Usage patterns logging and A/B testing support.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the significant Addon-plan features requested by the user, which aim to transform the AI Companion into an emotionally intelligent, memory-aware, and voice-native product.

Specifically, the following new agent files have been created in the  directory:
-   : Responsible for classifying user sentiment and energy from utterances.
-   : Designed to dynamically choose conversation modes, prosody, and response length based on various factors.
-   : Handles conversational repair, such as detecting and correcting misheard phrases (Did you mean...?).
-   : Manages the initiation and flow of micro-games when silence or low engagement is detected.
-   : Will handle in-session memory and persist daily interaction summaries to the database.
-   : For tracking usage patterns, A/B testing flags, and session metrics.

The  has already been updated to integrate the , , , and . The  was updated to support prosody, and  was updated to support dialogue plans.

The immediate task at hand is to update the main  to fully include and utilize the newly created  and , ensuring that the core dialogue flow can leverage long-term memory and collect usage data. This work is focused on enhancing the backend's intelligence and contextual awareness, building upon the recently completed MVP and ambient listening features. The product is moving towards a more sophisticated, human-like interaction model.
